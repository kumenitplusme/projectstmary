            <p>St. Mary’s University (SMU) evolved from St. Mary’s Language School, which started operation in 1991, and, as a college, it was established in 1998 with campuses in Addis Ababa and Hawassa. Upon establishment, the College had its Head Office in Hawassa, which moved to Addis Ababa in 1999. <p>Showing noticeable growth through time and after the rigorous evaluation by the Ethiopian Relevance and Quality Agency, it was awarded a university status in 2013— an exclusive club of only 5 private universities among over 300 private higher learning institutions in the country.</p>
            <p>SMU offers accredited undergraduate and graduate programs in diverse fields of studies in the conventional and distance modes of learning fully accredited by the national quality assurance organization.</p> 
            <p>At present, it offers programmes in Accounting, Computing Science, Management, Marketing Management, and Tourism and Hospitality Management in the regular and extension classes at undergraduate level.</p>
            <p>The regular graduate programmes offered by the School of Graduate Studies include MBA programmes in General Management, Human Resource Management, Accounting and Finance, Impact Entrepreneurship, Project Management and Masters in Marketing Management, Development Economics, Computer Science, Agri-Economics, Development Management, Social Work and Quality and Productivity Management.

SMU has a strong research culture to advance conducive environment for students, academics, researchers and practitioners. The University organizes four conferences annually. The International Conference on Private Higher Education in Africa, which draws world-class scholars and researchers from across the world, has been held for the last nineteen years without interruption. </p>

            <p>SMU actively engages in the socio-economic development of Ethiopia. Its commitment to the quality of its services and contributions toward the enhancement of higher education in Ethiopia has won it public and government credibility. The 19 conferences held over the last two decades have been recognized by the association of African Universities which has become a collaborator since 2010. The president of SMU has been chosen to serve as a jury member of the Ethiopian Quality Award which works toward improving the quality of services and products of companies in Ethiopia and receives annual recognition from the nation’s Office of the President on annual basis.</p>

The University has been awarded cups and certificates for its contributions by the various community groups and organizations. </p>
            <p>

 

SMU has two campuses: one for undergraduate and the other for graduate programs; both of them are a walking distance from the headquarters of the African Union. Both campuses are located at the heart of the city right at the popular Mexico Square.</p>
        
            
            <p> 
The Multi-disciplinary Seminar, which brings scholars and practitioners in diverse areas, has been organized for 13 years continuously. The Student Research Forum, which provides special opportunity for students to practice and demonstrate 21st century skills, has been organized for 15 years.
